# Contributing to Emergent Intelligence Validation

Thank you for your interest in advancing the science of emergent intelligence! 🜃

## How to Contribute

### 1. Run Experiments

The most valuable contributions are **empirical validations**:

- Replicate existing experiments
- Test with different parameters
- Apply to new domains
- Add agent capabilities (communication, learning)

**Share your results** by opening an issue with:
- Your modified code
- Results summary
- Plots/data
- Interpretation

### 2. Extend the Theory

- Propose formula modifications
- Add new metrics
- Test alternative hypotheses
- Mathematical proofs

### 3. Improve Code

- Optimize performance
- Add features
- Fix bugs
- Improve documentation

### 4. Real-World Applications

- Apply to actual systems
- Case studies
- Domain-specific implementations

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make** your changes
4. **Test** thoroughly
5. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
6. **Push**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. **Submit** a pull request

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 (Python style guide)
- Add docstrings to functions
- Include comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Experiment Standards

 When sharing experiments:

- **Document parameters** clearly
- **Provide seed** for reproducibility
- **Include sample size** and effect sizes
- **Share plots** and statistical tests
- **Interpret results** in context of EI theory

## Areas of High Interest

### Critical Questions

1. **What is the Φ threshold** where inverted-U emerges?
2. **How does EI apply** to neural network training?
3. **Can EI predict** real-world team performance?
4. **What coordination mechanisms** maximize EI?

### Experimental Priorities

- ⭐ **High-Φ systems** (add communication)
- ⭐ **Neural networks** (apply to actual AI training)
- ⭐ **Human experiments** (validate in real cognition)
- ⭐ **Longitudinal studies** (track EI over development)
